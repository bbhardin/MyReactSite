                competition system. The system incentives residents to participate in the college and earn more points
                than other dorm floors. The app is used by over 900 students and faculty and also includes features such
                as events happening around Honors and laundry machine status updates.

                to offset your driving as well as how many hamburgers you would have to avoid eating to offset your
                environmental impact.

            <div className="leftContentInsets">A simple smart light control panel using IFTTT hooks built on a window switch control panel from a 2001
                Mercedes ML320. Each switch corresponds to a different ceiling light, and the inputs are digital on/off based
                on if the user pulls up on each switch. I would like to get an analogue to digital convertor so
                I can monitor the switch resistance to determine if user is pulling up or down and adjust the lights accordingly.
                I would also like to add the ability to hold the switch up or down to slowly dim/brighten.</div>
